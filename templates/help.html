        <h2>Training Days</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lines beginning with <code>Week #</code> (e.g. <code>Week 1</code>, <code>Week 2</code>, etc) will start a new week</li>
            <li>Underneath each <code>Week #</code>, lines which contain <code>Monday</code>...<code>Sunday</code> will start a new training day</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each line underneath a training day will be interpreted as a lift, followed by sets and reps for that lift.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lifts</h2>
        A typical lift line is written as follows:
        <code>PSn {snatch}: 60/2 65/2 70/2 (75/1)2</code>

        <ul>
            <li>The section before the colon indicates the name of the lift, with an optional "base lift" name in curly braces (e.g. <code>{snatch}</code>).</li>
            <li>If a base lift is present, it will be used to calculate any percentages on the rest of the line</li>
            <li> Sets and reps are written after the colon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sets and Reps</h2>

        Sets and reps are written as comma or space separated fields. The following are
        the three valid ways to write the same sets/reps prescription: 
        <ul>
            <li><code>60%/3</code>:  1 set of 3 reps at 60%</li>
            <li><code>60/3</code>: 1 set of 3 reps at 60%</li>
            <li><code>(60/3)/1</code>: 1 set of 3 reps at 60%</li>
        </ul>

        All reps will ignore "+" characters, so that you can also write complexes as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><code>60%/3+3</code></li>
            <li><code>60/3+3</code></li>
            <li><code>(60/3+3)/1</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Go for a max!</h2>

        Sometimes, you may want to give a freeform sentence instead of rigid sets and
        reps for a given lift.  You can do this by enclosing your sentence in square
        brackets and putting it in place of a sets/reps scheme. For example:

        <code>Clean & Jerk: [singles to max (two misses/10 attempts)]</code>

        <h2>Off Days</h2>

        If you simply omit a day, it just won't be included in the output table. In the
        example below, Tuesday of Week 1 just won't be included in the output. However,
        you may want to explicitly state that a day is an "off" day. You can do this by
        just writting the word <code>Off</code> underneath that day, which will create
        a special row in the output file that just says "Off".

        <h2>Example</h2>

        The following is a short snippet from an example input programming file:

        <pre>
Week 1
Monday
Power Snatch + Overhead Squat {snatch}: 60%/3+3, (70%/3+3)3
Power Clean + Jerk. {c&j}: 60%/3+3, (70%/3+3)3 
Back Squat {squat}: 60%/3, 70%/3, (80%/3)3
Good Morning: (X/6)4 

Wednesday
Off

Friday
Power Snatch + Overhead Squat {snatch}: 60%/3+3, (70%/3+3)3
Power Clean + Jerk {c&j}: 60%/3+3, (70%/3+3)3 
Clean Extension {c&j}: (85%/3)3
Back Squat {squat}: 60%/3, 70%/3, 80%/3 (85/3)3
Good Morning: (X/6)4 

Week 2
Tuesday
Press: (X/5)4 
PCl Abv Kn {clean}: [As many reps as possible until you explode]

<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading"><h2>Maxes File Format</h2></div>
    <div class="panel-body">

        Maxes files are used to generate training outputs in bulk. Each line in the file will contain all of the maxes for a given trainee.

        <pre>Rand Voorhies | snatch: 86, c&j: 105,  squat: 156
Ilya Ilyin | snatch: 191, c&j: 246, squat: 350
Lu Xiaojun | snatch: 176, c&j: 204, squat: 300</pre>

        <ul>
            <li> The trainee name should be first on the line, followed by a <code>|</code> character.  </li>
            <li> Following the name should be a comma-separated list of maxes where each max is written as <code>MaxName: MaxValue</code></li>

            <li> <span class="label label-warning">Note</span> These max names <b>must</b> be written exactly as they are in the training program file. For example, things will get screwed up if you write <code>c&j</code> in the training file, but write <code>Clean And Jerk</code> in the maxes file.</li>

        </ul>
